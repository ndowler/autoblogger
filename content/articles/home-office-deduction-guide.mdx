Are you using part of your home for your business and wondering whether you can deduct it — and if it's worth the paperwork? The home office deduction can cut both your income tax and self‑employment tax, but the rules are specific and mistakes can be costly. This guide walks you through who qualifies, how to compute the deduction, the tradeoffs between methods, and specific issues for Washington and Oregon small‑business owners.

We summarize federal rules in effect through June 2024 and provide practical state/local considerations for WA and OR. Tax law can change — always confirm limits and state conformity for the current filing year or contact FoxGlove CPA before filing.

## Quick snapshot: who can claim and how much
- Who can claim: self‑employed taxpayers (Schedule C), independent contractors, certain partners, and owners reimbursed under an accountable plan (common for S‑corp owner‑employees). **Most W‑2 employees cannot claim a federal home office deduction for tax years 2018–2025** because of the TCJA suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions.
- Two calculation methods:
  - **Simplified method:** $5.00 per sq ft, up to 300 sq ft (max $1,500).
  - **Actual (regular) method:** prorate real expenses by business‑use percentage (business sq ft ÷ total home sq ft).
- Key requirement: the space must be used **regularly and exclusively** for business and generally be your **principal place of business** (with exceptions such as daycare providers or storage of inventory/product samples).

## Eligibility — detailed rules
### Regular and exclusive use
- The area must be used regularly for business and used only for business during those times. A dedicated spare bedroom office qualifies; a dining table used occasionally does not.
- Keep photos and a floor plan to substantiate exclusive use.

### Principal place of business test
- Your home office generally must be used for administrative or management tasks and there must be no other fixed location where you perform substantial administrative or management activities.
- If you meet clients or customers at home, that can also satisfy the principal place test.

### Exceptions to exclusive‑use
- Day‑care providers and certain storage uses can qualify without strict exclusive‑use. See IRS Pub 587 for specifics.
- Storage of inventory or product samples for business may qualify even if the space isn’t exclusively used.

### Who cannot claim
- Most W‑2 employees: no federal deduction through 2025 unless reimbursed by the employer under an accountable plan. State rules vary — see the state section below and consult FoxGlove CPA.

## Methods & calculations

### A. Simplified method
- Rate: $5.00 per sq ft (IRS simplified rate as of mid‑2024).
- Max area: 300 sq ft → maximum deduction = $1,500.
- No depreciation allowed; no Form 8829 needed.
- Best when office is small or recordkeeping burden of actual method outweighs benefits.

### B. Actual (regular) method
- Business‑use percentage = business sq ft ÷ total home sq ft (or count rooms if sizes are similar).
- Direct expenses (repairs or improvements only for the office) are fully deductible.
- Indirect expenses (mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, general repairs, depreciation) are deductible up to the business‑use percentage.
- Use Form 8829 with Schedule C to compute the deduction. Depreciation uses the residential recovery period (27.5 years) applied only to the business portion of the home's basis (exclude land).
- Limitation: deduction for the home office cannot exceed the gross income from the business attributable to the use of the home; any excess can carry forward (for Schedule C taxpayers).

### C. Choosing a method
- Simplified is easier and avoids depreciation recapture on sale.
- Actual method often yields a larger deduction when you have sizable mortgage interest, property taxes, or depreciation.
- Best practice: compute both methods each year and choose the larger deduction.
- Note: if you claimed depreciation under the actual method and later switch to simplified, allowed depreciation still affects future sale reporting (recapture). Consult FoxGlove CPA before switching methods if you have claimed depreciation.

## Forms & reporting
- Sole proprietors: Schedule C (Form 1040); Form 8829 for actual method; Form 4562 for depreciation.
- Partners: partnership-level rules and reimbursements may affect how deductions are taken.
- S‑corp owner‑employees:
  - Owner‑employees generally cannot take the deduction directly on a personal return.
  - Preferred approach: S‑corp reimburses home office expenses under an **accountable plan** (non‑taxable to the employee; deductible by S‑corp).
  - Alternative: rent part of the home to the S‑corp (report rental on Schedule E) — this is complex and should be reviewed with a CPA for reasonableness and tax consequences.
- Employees of others (W‑2): generally cannot claim the federal deduction through 2025; encourage employer reimbursement via an accountable plan.
- Key forms: Form 8829, Schedule C, Form 4562, Schedule E, and W‑2 reporting where applicable.

## Depreciation and sale of your home
- If you claimed depreciation on the business portion, you must recapture depreciation when you sell: the depreciation allowed/allowable after 2008 is taxable as ordinary income (maximum equal to the gain).
- Home sale exclusion (Section 121): up to $250K/$500K for single/married filers applies to gain on a main home, but the portion of gain attributable to allowed depreciation is **not** eligible for exclusion.
- If you used the simplified method, you didn’t claim depreciation — simplifying sale tax consequences.

## Interaction with self‑employment tax
- Home office deduction reduces net profit on Schedule C, lowering Self‑Employment (SE) tax.
- SE tax rough formula: SE tax ≈ 0.9235 × (net self‑employment income) × 15.3%.
- So reducing net income with a home office deduction lowers both income tax and SE tax.

## Practical examples

### Example A — Simplified method
- Home = 1,600 sq ft; dedicated office = 200 sq ft.
- Simplified deduction = 200 sq ft × $5 = **$1,000**.

### Example B — Actual method (basic)
- Same home: 1,600 sq ft; office = 200 sq ft → business % = 12.5%.
- Annual home expenses:
  - Mortgage interest: $12,000
  - Property tax: $3,000
  - Homeowner’s insurance: $1,200
  - Utilities: $3,600
  - Repairs & maintenance: $2,000 (with $500 direct to office)
  - Depreciable basis allocated to house: $200,000 → business portion basis = $25,000 (12.5%). Depreciation over 27.5 years ≈ $909 annually.
- Deduction calculation:
  - Indirect expenses total (mortgage interest + property tax + insurance + utilities + general repairs): $21,800 × 12.5% = $2,725.
  - Direct repairs to office = $500.
  - Depreciation = $909.
  - Total home office deduction ≈ **$4,134**.
- Comparison: simplified = $1,000; actual = $4,134 → actual method is better here.

### Example C — Effect on federal income & SE tax (approximate)
- Assume marginal tax rate = 24% and SE tax effective rate ≈ 15.3%:
  - SE tax factor for deduction ≈ 0.9235 × 15.3% ≈ 14.14%.
  - Combined federal tax + SE impact ≈ 24% + 14.14% ≈ 38.14%.
  - For a $4,134 deduction → estimated tax savings ≈ $4,134 × 38.14% ≈ **$1,577** (approximate — use precise calculations for exact amounts).

## Special situations & S‑corp owners
- S‑corp owner‑employee:
  - Implement a written accountable plan: reimburse substantiated expenses; reimbursements are non‑taxable to the employee and deductible by the S‑corp.
  - Avoid classifying reimbursements as wages (which would be taxable and subject to payroll taxes).
  - Renting part of the home to your S‑corp is possible but complex: rental income must be reported (Schedule E), depreciation may create recapture, and the IRS will look at reasonableness.
  - Always document an accountable plan and keep substantiation (receipts, allocation worksheet) on file.
- Partnerships: ensure partnership agreement and allocations handle home office costs appropriately; partners cannot simply use Schedule C.
- W‑2 remote employees: encourage employer to set up an accountable plan for reimbursements (otherwise employees generally cannot take the deduction on federal returns).

## State & local considerations — Washington vs Oregon

Washington (WA)
- No state individual income tax — the federal home office deduction affects federal taxable income and SE tax but not WA income tax (since none).
- Washington’s Business & Occupation (B&O) tax is based on gross receipts (not net income) — home office deductions do **not** reduce B&O tax.
- Local permits: many cities require a business license or home‑occupation permit (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma). Verify city/county rules.
- Property classification: using a portion of a home for business typically does not change residential classification, but confirm with your county assessor if you run retail/outside operations.

Oregon (OR)
- Oregon has state income tax. Federal adjustments (like the home office deduction reducing federal AGI) generally flow to Oregon taxable income, but Oregon conformity may vary by year — check OR Dept. of Revenue or consult FoxGlove CPA for current year conformity.
- W‑2 employees: Oregon generally conforms to federal treatment of miscellaneous itemized deductions; therefore, employees typically cannot claim a federally disallowed home office deduction on their Oregon return either — verify current year rules.
- Local permits: cities (Portland, Eugene, Salem) may require home business licenses or home occupation permits.
- No statewide sales tax in Oregon, but local business licensing and zoning still apply.

General local/regulatory points for both states
- Zoning and HOA covenants may limit customer visits, signage, and the types of business allowed at home.
- Homeowner’s insurance often excludes business liability — consider a business policy or rider.
- Using a PO Box or virtual office does not create home office eligibility for the deduction; the primary business use must be at home.

## Documentation checklist — what to keep
- Floor plan or measurements showing business area and total area; dated photos.
- Receipts/statements: Form 1098 (mortgage interest), property tax bills, insurance, utility bills, repair invoices.
- Records of direct office expenses (furniture, repairs).
- Depreciation schedule and allocation for basis between house vs land.
- Written accountable plan and reimbursement substantiation (for S‑corps).
- Evidence the home is your principal place of business: client invoices, contracts, calendars showing administrative tasks performed at home.
- Local permits, business license, and zoning approvals.

## Common mistakes & pitfalls
- Claiming a home office without meeting the **exclusive‑use** requirement.
- Failing to compare simplified vs actual methods each year.
- Not tracking depreciation properly — leading to unexpected recapture tax when you sell.
- Double‑deducting the same expense (e.g., claiming mortgage interest twice).
- S‑corp owners failing to use an accountable plan and treating reimbursements as personal deductions.
- Overlooking local zoning, HOA, or insurance restrictions.

## Best practices — FoxGlove CPA recommendations
- Each year, compute both simplified and actual methods and choose the higher deduction.
- Keep contemporaneous documentation: measure and photograph the space, save receipts, and keep a simple worksheet.
- For S‑corp owners: adopt a written accountable plan, require substantiation, and reimburse reasonable amounts monthly.
- Before renting your home to your business, consult FoxGlove CPA to evaluate tax, recapture, and reasonableness implications.
- If you're a remote employee, ask your employer about an accountable plan or non‑taxable reimbursement.
- Review your homeowner insurance for business coverage and check local zoning/permit rules annually.
- Keep depreciation records separate and update them — necessary for sale reporting.

## Actionable checklist for clients
- Measure and document office sq ft and total home sq ft; take dated photos.
- Run both simplified and actual calculations for the current year.
- If using actual method: gather Form 1098, property tax bills, insurance, utility bills, repair invoices; prepare Form 8829 and Form 4562 for depreciation.
- If S‑corp: draft a written accountable plan and implement monthly reimbursements with receipts.
- Confirm local business license and home occupation permit requirements with your city/county.
- Schedule an annual review with FoxGlove CPA to confirm method choice, depreciation handling, and state conformity.
